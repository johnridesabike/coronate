<h1>Chessahoochee</h1>

Chessahoochee is an app for managing Swiss-style chess tournaments. I built it to help the chess players at Chattahoochee Valley Libraries, which is where the name comes from.

**Why use Chessahoochee?** A while ago, I began facilitating a chess tournament and discovered an absence of free tournament software. Although directing a tournament the old-fashioned way is possible, software ensures that your tournament runs smoothly and correctly. This app aims to fill that gap.

**What Chessahoochee is:** A free, easy-to-use, app that can manage your player roster, calculate scores and ratings, and create pairings. It tries to provide features similar to those found in professional tournament apps. If you run a small, free, unrated club, then this app may be useful for you.

**What Chessahoochee is not:** It is not affiliated with USCF, FIDE, or any other chess organizations. It should not be used in rated tournaments. For those, you're better off paying for pro software.

## Status

This project is mostly 1.0 feature-complete, but still very much in a beta phase. I recommend you poke around and try it out, but *do not use it for your tournament yet*. Things may break unexpectedly!

Want to help make it better? Great! [Read this to get started](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Goals for this project include:

- Create a free, portable, easy-to-use chess tournament manager.
- Implement procedures consistent with USCF and FIDE rules.
- Ensure that the software is usable on a wide range of platforms and input methods, including PCs, tablets, and screen readers.
- Create readable, documented source code so the larger community can continue to develop new tournament apps as needed.
