At the moment, this project is so small and unstable that I'm not actively seeking contributions. This will hopefully change soon, once the vision for the end product becomes clearer.

If you're interested, here's my general to-do list:

## API
- Complete pairing logic to account for all USCF §27 guidelines.
- Add exceptions for cases with odd numbers of players.
- Add tie-breaking logic.
- Improve adding or removing players after a tournament has begun.
- Add rating calculations.
- Improve test coverage to account for more situations.
- Clean up code.
- Write documentation for API and data structure.
- Add I/O for saving and loading data across sessions.

## Front-end
- Build a functional front-end UI.

## Beyond the horizon
- Add round robin pairings.
- Build an awesome front-end UI.
- Package into a standalone Electron app.
- Publish a web demo.

If you have any questions, just open a new issue.
